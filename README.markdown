**The Shattering of Azeroth**

In the frigid wastes of Northrend, the final battle against the merciless Lich
King ended in victory for Azeroth's defenders. Upon returning home, veterans
of the unforgiving conflict against the Scourge were showered with praise for
their valiant sacrifices, while the honorable dead were mourned. Yet as hope
flared anew in the wake of the Lich King's fall, Azeroth's native elemental
spirits grew confused and erratic, setting off a series of deadly natural
disasters. Horde and Alliance leaders scrambled for clues about the troubling
state of the world, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.

Without warning, the corrupted Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, erupted from the
stone heart of Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane.
Jagged fissures were torn across the earth, and monstrous waves pummeled
coastal regions. From Thousand Needles to the Blasted Lands, the surface of
Azeroth was reforged through violent upheavals. Now, the Horde and the
Alliance must defend their homes against Deathwing and his minions, burdened
by the unsettling fact that the world as they know it has changed... forever.

**General**

  * Azeroth Shattered

    * Deathwing's return has had an immeasurable impact throughout the Eastern
Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Players will notice drastically altered terrain,
thousands of new quests from levels 1-55, and updated level ranges for some
zones to improve the questing flow.

  * New Race/Class Combinations

    * In the wake of a world on the brink of destruction, members of the Horde
and Alliance have taken to new cultures and studies, mastering crafts
previously foreign to them. Many existing playable races now have new class
combinations. Check the official World of Warcraft: Cataclysm [website][1] for
a breakdown of the new combinations.

  * The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm cinematic trailer and login screen have
been added to the game.

  * Experience required to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by 20%,
which increases leveling rate by 25%.

**Classes: General**

  * Due to several talent revisions for select classes, druids, paladins,
priests, and shaman have had their talent trees reset.

  * The damage and healing done by players from levels 1-79 has been retuned,
with the base points of almost all spells and abilities reduced. This was done
to bring combat times at low levels to a more reasonable length. For most
abilities that deal weapon damage, the weapon damage percent now rises per
level until level 80, and starts at a lower percent.

  * Healing Rain, Efflorescence, Holy Radiance, Holy Word: Sanctuary now have
a diminished effect when healing more than 6 players at once.

  * Mortal Strike, Furious Attacks, Wound Poison, Widow Venom, Permafrost,
Improved Mind Blast, Monstrous Bite, and Legion Strike now reduce healing by
10%, down from 25%.

  * Effects which are broken from taking too much damage (Fear, Frost Nova,
Entangling Roots, etc.) now break automatically from about half as much damage
taken as before.

**Death Knights**

  * Death Pact now heals for 25% of maximum health, down from 40%.

from 30%, and will heal for a minimum of 7% of maximum health, down from 10%.
The tooltip may not yet be updated to reflect this change.

50%, down from 60% when talented), and has a 3-minute cooldown, up from 2
minutes.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Blood

      * Rune Tap now heals for 10% of maximum health, down from 15%. The
tooltip may not yet be updated to reflect this change.

target selected.

kept up at all times. In addition, Thorns damage has been reduced by 60%.

  * Talent Specializations

    * Balance

      * PvP set bonus redesigned. While not in an Eclipse state, critical
attacks against the druid restore 5 Solar or 7 Lunar energy, whichever is more
beneficial. This effect can only occur once every 6 seconds.

2/4/6%, down from 3/7/10%.

      * Malfurion's Gift no longer has Fury of Stormrage as a prerequisite
talent.

      * Natural Shapeshifter now also increases Tree of Life duration by 5/10
seconds.

      * Revitalize is now a 2-point talent, down from 3. It provides a 20%

Lifebloom or Rejuvenation. This effect cannot occur more than once every 12
seconds.

      * Swift Rejuvenation is now a 1-point talent, down from 2. The global
cooldown reduction this talent provides to Rejuvenation remains 0.5 seconds.

      * Symbiosis: heal-over-time spells (Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Lifebloom)
can no longer benefit from this Mastery merely by refreshing themselves. A
different heal-over-time spell must be present.

  * Glyphs

    * Glyph of Healing Touch now reduces the cooldown on Nature's Swiftness by
10 seconds after using Healing Touch, up from 5 seconds.

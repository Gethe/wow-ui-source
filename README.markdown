  * Death Coil damage has been reduced by roughly 10%.

immunity to them.

    * Blood

      * Bone Shield now has 4 charges, up from 3.

      * Crimson Scourge has been redesigned slightly. Instead of a 50/100%
chance to make the next Blood Boil free when Plague Strike is used on a target
with Blood Plague, the talent now gives a 5/10% chance to provide a free Blood
Boil when the death knight lands any melee attack on a Blood Plagued target.

from 120% plus 10% per disease.

30/60/90%, up from 15/30/45%.

new absorb will stack with the old one instead of replacing it.

      * Scarlet Fever now applies via Blood Plague, rather than Blood Boil.

      * Will of the Necropolis no longer refunds a Blood Rune when it resets
Rune Tap's cooldown. Instead it makes the next Rune Tap free while Will of the
Necropolis is active.

seconds to the existing aura duration, instead of simply
refreshing/overwriting the existing aura.

      * Shadow Infusion now increases pet damage by 8% per stack, down from

down from 10%.

      * Virulence has been redesigned. It now grants 10/20/30% additional

longer a considerable pause after losing control of the ghoul before being

addition, Berserk no longer breaks Fear or makes the druid immune to Fear.

  * Forbearance

    * The duration has been lowered to 1 minute, down from 2.

    * Lay on Hands now causes Forbearance on the target. It used to only cause
it when cast on the paladin. This was an old design from when Divine
Protection caused Forbearance and the paladin didn't want to prevent a tank
from using their defensive cooldown.

    * Lay on Hands cannot be a critical effect and will not be affected by
most abilities which modify healing (such as Beacon of Light). In addition,
Lay on Hands is no longer on the global cooldown.

immune targets. With Rebuke baseline, this functionality is no longer
necessary.

impairing effects from vehicles the paladin is riding.

      * Divine Purpose: The chance for applicable abilities to generate Holy
Power has been reduced to 7/15%, down from 20/40%, but instead of generating 1
Holy Power, the next applicable ability used consumes no Holy Power and acts
as if the paladin has 3 Holy Power.

      * Divine Storm weapon damage percent increased from 80% to 100%.

      * Hand of Light (Mastery): A percentage of the damage done by Templar's
Verdict, Crusader Strike, and Divine Storm is done as additional Holy damage.

2.5%.

seconds.

  * Paladin Bug Fixes

    * The Silence debuff from Avenger's Shield was using the Dazed visual
effect, and its Daze debuff did not have a visible effect. This has been
remedied.

paladin has no paladin auras active.

    * Divine Storm no longer incorrectly highlights when Hand of Light procs.

    * Exorcism automatically re-targets whomever it does damage to when it
finishes casting.

    * The healing amount in the buff tooltip for Holy Radiance is now
accurate.

stunned by the Fire mage talent Impact. Conversely, Pursuit of Justice is no
longer granting Holy Power when the Paladin is hit by Holy Wrath.

    * Repentance tooltip now states that it does not break Censure damage.

    * Rank 1 of Shield of the Templar was reducing the cooldown of Guardian of
Ancient Kings by 45 seconds, which is inconsistent with the scaling of ranks 2
and 3. This has been adjusted.

    * The tooltip for Tower of Radiance indicated that Holy Light would
generate a charge of Holy Power. This has been fixed.

    * Word of Glory no longer resets the swing timer.

Points who have already purchased all of the gear that interests them.

Nefarian or Cho'gall on Heroic difficulty. Instead, the Heroic PvE helm and

done by the next 2 Fel Flame spells by 300%, rather than increasing the
critical effect chance of one by 100%.

Primary stats are very powerful in Cataclysm, so much so that players were
considering using PvP gear in PvE just because of these primary stat bonuses.

    * The PvP Balance druid 4-piece set bonus effect has been increased to 20
Solar Energy and 13 Lunar Energy, up from 5 and 13. The effect will also now

a party member.

healing/damaging spells.

**World of Warcraft Client Patch 4.1**

Notes for all World of Warcraft patches can be found [here][1].

**[Rise of the Zandalari][2]**

_ The days when great troll empires stretched across ancient Kalimdor are long
past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of
their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the
Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These
dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and
scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They
have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a
single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the
Gurubashi and Amani nations—Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman—are already rebuilding,
replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.

Yet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They
have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades—and even work with the
Alliance—should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be
forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their
own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the
ancient troll empires once again. _

**[Guild Challenges][3]**

Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are
weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience,
achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a
new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories:
Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for
Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can
be completed per week.

**[Guild Finder][4]**

Guild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild
recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call
home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications
that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader
looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your
strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new
friends!

**[Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms][5]**

A new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms
offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role.
To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random
level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and
complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these
requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will
contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good
chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a
very rare chance at receiving a mount.

**General**

  * Conquest Points are now purchasable from the Valor Quartermasters at 250
Conquest Points per 250 Valor Points.

  * Honor Points are now purchasable from the Justice Trade Goods vendors at
250 Honor Points per 375 Justice Points.

  * Justice Points are now purchasable from the Honor Trade Goods vendors at
250 Justice Points per 375 Honor Points.

  * Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to
increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40
resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to
10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A
player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their
damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain
slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as
their resilience climbs.

  * A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or
Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.

**[Achievements][27]**

  * A new feat of strength with an associated title, "the Camel-Hoarder", has
been added for players that have bested Dormus and obtained the Reins of the
Grey Riding Camel -- because there must always be a Camel-Hoarder.

  * PvP

    * The following Battleground achievements have been permanently removed
from the game, as they do not function correctly with the achievement tracking
system: Guild Gankin' in Gilneas, Guild Gulch, The Peak of Perfection, The
Perfect Guild Storm, Storming the Beach.

    * Rated Battlegrounds

      * The achievements to win 100 rated Battlegrounds have been renamed to
"Veteran of the Alliance" and "Veteran of the Horde", and now award those
titles.

      * Achievements to win 300 rated Battlegrounds have been added, awarding
the "Warbound" and "Warbringer" titles to the Alliance and Horde respectively.

    * Arathi Basin

      * The achievement "We Had It All Along *cough*" now requires the player
to win Arathi Basin by 50 points or less, up from 10 points or less.

      * The achievement "Jugger Not" now requires the player to win The Battle
for Gilneas by 100 points or less, up from 10 points or less.

in a single battle, down from 3.

player to assault 2 bases in a single battle, down from 3.

the target. This includes Pummel, Kick, Mind Freeze, Rebuke, Skull Bash,
Counterspell, Wind Shear, Solar Beam, Silencing Shot, and related player pet
abilities.

hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual
effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players:
Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap,
Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the
alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an
enemy player.

**[Death Knights][29]**

  * Dark Simulacrum now works on numerous additional spells in dungeon
encounters.

  * Raise Ally has been redesigned to be a battle resurrection, analogous to
Rebirth. It is instant cast, but costs 50 Runic Power to use, and has a
10-minute cooldown. It shares the same global battle resurrection cap with
Rebirth and Soulstone.

      * Death Strike self-healing no longer generates threat.

same as 4.0.6 numbers. In addition, Howling Blast now has a facing
requirement.

    * Unholy

      * Desecration no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-

benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical
effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for

minutes.

    * These challenges can be found in the Info pane of the guild UI.

    * Guild Challenges fall into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated
Battlegrounds.

    * Each challenge can be completed a set number of times per week. Guild
groups participating in level-appropriate Heroic or normal difficulty dungeons
and raids, or rated Battlegrounds, will automatically qualify for challenge
credit.

    * Each time a Guild Challenge is completed, the guild will be awarded
experience and gold deposited directly into the Guild Vault, as well as the
opportunity to earn all-new achievements. A popup or "toast" will be displayed
to confirm a Guild Challenge has been completed (similar to achievement
alerts).

    * Guild experience earned via Guild Challenges will be awarded above the
daily cap. The experience cap will move forward relative to the amount of
experience obtained through completing Guild Challenges (similar to rested
experience for characters).

    * Guilds already at the level cap will be awarded substantially more gold
in place of guild experience.

    * Gold rewards are deposited into the guild bank once the guild reaches
level 5. The text for the Cash Flow guild perk has been updated appropriately.

  * Guild Finder

    * A new Guild Finder button will now appear on the Micro Menu for guild
leaders, as well as players without a guild.

    * A Guild Interests field allows players to form a guild around common
interests: Questing, Dungeons, Raids, PvP, and Role Playing.

    * An Availability field allows players to note whether or not weekdays or
weekends are better for playing.

    * The Class Roles field allows players to indicate the role or roles they
are capable of, and willing to fill.

    * A Comment box is also available for supplying additional information.

    * Once a player has filled out the Guild Interests field, the Browse
Guilds tab allows them to find guilds actively recruiting via the Guild
Finder. Guilds listed here are displayed according to common interests.

    * The Requests tab tracks all recruitment requests submitted by an
unguilded player, or submitted to the leader of a selected guild.

  * The Guild Perk, Cash Flow, no longer prints out text to the Chat Log.
Instead, the daily amount deposited is shown in the Guild Vault Money Log. In
addition, players can view the weekly contribution in a new window at the
bottom of the Money Log.

  * Two new custom guild tabards have been added as Guild Rewards. The tabards
are account bound and offer a bonus to gaining guild reputation.

field.

**[Items][41]**

  * Account Bound Items

    * Many "Account Bound" heirlooms are now labeled as "Battle.net Account
Bound", meaning that they can also be traded or mailed to characters that are
on different World of Warcraft accounts under the same Battle.net account.

    * Mail sent to characters on the same Battle.net account now arrives
instantaneously, as it does for the same World of Warcraft account.

    * Mailing account-bound items to characters of the opposite faction on the
same Battle.net account will now correctly translate faction-specific items to
their appropriate equivalent.

    * All trade goods available for purchase with Honor or Justice Points from
the associated commodities vendors have had their prices reduced by 50%.

    * Maelstrom Crystals are now available for purchase with Honor or Justice
Points from the associated commodities vendors.

  * The PvP Horde and Alliance trinkets have a new spell effect.

grants increased attack power when Killing Machine triggers, as well as when
the death knight gains Death Runes).

    * The current Holy paladin 4-piece raid set bonus now grants 540 Spirit
for 6 seconds after casting Holy Shock.

    * The current healing priest 4-piece raid set bonus no longer requires a
target to be under the effects of Weakened Soul for the priest to receive the
Spirit bonus. Instead the benefit will be granted each time the priest's
Penance spell heals a target.

    * The caster shaman 4-piece PvP set bonus now reduces the cooldown of
Grounding Totem by 3 seconds, up from 1.5.

  * Battlegrounds

    * Battleground raid leaders can now move players from other realms among
raid subgroups.

    * The Focused Assault and Brutal Assault buffs have changed.

      * After 3 minutes of both teams having the flag, both flag carriers will
get Focused Assault, which increases damage taken by 10%.

      * Every minute afterward, an additional stack will be applied to
increase damage taken by an additional 10%.

      * After 7 minutes, Brutal Assault will be applied in place of Focused
Assault. In additional to the damage debuff, this debuff also caps the
player's movement speed at 100%. The damage taken debuff works the same and
will add 10% to the debuff up to a maximum of 100% damage taken.

    * Arathi Basin

      * Arathi Basin is now available as a 10v10-player rated Battleground.

      * Flags should now cap in 7 seconds, down from 8.

teleported to the next closest graveyard, instead of the one at which they
died.

        * If a player's team owns the Mine and Waterworks, and dies at
Waterworks, they will be teleported to the Mine.

        * If an Alliance player's team only owns Lighthouse, and dies at
Lighthouse, they will respawn at their base.

        * Attacking players will respawn at their base graveyard.

**[Quests & Creatures][44]**

  * A handful of quests have been added to Northern Barrens to provide more
level 18-20 content. Look for new quests at Nozzlepot's Outpost and Darsok's
Outpost.

  * Loot from the creatures Garr, Julak-Doom, Mobus, Akma'Hat, Xariona, and
Poseidus has been adjusted to be commensurate to their rarity and invested
effort.

**[Races][45]**

  * The gnomish racial ability, Escape Artist, is no longer affected by the
global cooldowns triggered by other abilities.

  * The human racial ability, Every Man for Himself, has a new spell effect.

**[User Interface][46]**

  * Like the Focus Frame, the character Unit and Target Frames can now be
unlocked and moved to one's content.

  * Spells bound to a key now start to be cast when the button is pressed down
by default, instead of waiting for the key to go up. This is an option that
can be turned off in the Interface menu under Combat. Mouse clicking has not
changed and operates on mouse click up.

  * Targets and focus targets now display on the mini-map.

  * Moved Video and Sound to a new "Options" screen.

  * Added a network category to the new Options screen and included the two
network checkboxes.

    * The Network category contains the options "Optimize network for speed"
and "Enable IPv6 when available". "Optimize network for speed" will be enabled
by default, and will send packets more frequently at the cost of higher
bandwidth. The higher bandwidth may lead to disconnects for some players who
have limited bandwidth. Players getting disconnected frequently should try
unchecking this box.

  * Visual Settings Updates

    * Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to
ultra based on computer specs.

    * When a player moves the overall slider to a setting that would have
previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting
will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher.
For example: a player sets the overall slider to Ultra and the water setting
can only go to Fair. The water setting would automatically switch to Fair.

    * Support for DirectX 11 can now be found in the Advanced tab of the
Options screen.

  * At the login screen:

    * Moved the "Reset User Options" button from the popup window that appears
when clicking Options to the actual Options window.

    * Clicking Options now goes directly to the Video tab of the Options
screen.

    * Removed the now-unneeded popup.
